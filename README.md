# Cyclone Physics

This project is my attempt to follow along with the [Game physics engine development book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Game_Physics_Engine_Development/xdkjjlNdzBsC?hl=ar&gbpv=0).

## Status

- [X] Particle Physics
- [X] Particle Force Generators e.g. springs, Buoyancy
- [ ] Particle Constraints (complete, but buggy, might come back to it later)
- [ ] Rigid Body physics
